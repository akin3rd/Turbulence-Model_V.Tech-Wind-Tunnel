The files in this zipped folder contains a link to the Onedrive folder which holds the FLUENT case files for the medium mesh simulation on the Wind-tunnel High-speed test section. The Module leader has been granted access to this folder, however if any issues the repository owner should be contacted immediately.  

The folder also contains the MATLAB script used for post-processing of reuslts to obtain velocity and pressure gradients, dimensional and non-dimensional. The script also contains calculations for the scaling of the simulation from RANS to LES as instructed.

Another MATLAB script is included for the incomprssible and isothermal justification calculations based on ideal gas laws and isentropic relations
